* Introduction

Jpcap is a Java library for capturing and sending
network packets.

Jpcap is based on libpcap/winpcap.
So Jpcap is supposed to work on any OS which
supports libpcap/winpcap. 
Currently, Jpcap has been tested on Microsoft
Windows, Linux, FreeBSD, and Mac OS X.

Jpcap supports the following types of packets: 
Ethernet, IPv4, IPv6, ARP/RARP, TCP, UDP, and ICMPv4.  
Other types of packets are captured as raw packets 
(i.e., instances of the Packet class) which contains 
the whole data of the packets.  This allows Java applications 
to analyze unsupported packet types.


* Requirements:

  - Java Runtime Environment 6 or Java Development Kit 6 (http://java.sun.com)
  - libpcap ver.0.9.4 or higher (http://www.tcpdump.org)
    OR
  - WinPcap ver.3.1 or higher (http://winpcap.polito.it/)
