<p>This section explains how to compile WinPcap, both the kernel level and
the user-level portion, on the various Win32 platforms. The source code can be
found on the <a href="http://www.winpcap.org/">WinPcap website</a>.</p>
<h2>Compiling the driver</h2>
<p>Two main NPF source trees are available for compilation:&nbsp; Windows NTx and Windows 9x. Note that, since the NPF Driver is platform-dependent, it is
STRONGLY suggested to compile it on the OS where it will be used, in order to
link the correct DDK libraries. For example, if you compile the
driver with the Windows NT 4 DDK, it will not work properly on Windows 2000 and 
vice versa.</p>
<h3>Compiling the driver on Windows NT4</h3>
<p>Software requirements:</p>
<ul>
	<li>Microsoft Driver Developer Kit (DDK) for Windows NT4</li>
	<li>A recent version of the Microsoft Platform Software Development Kit 
	(SDK) that is compatible with Visual Studio 6 (the latest compatible one is 
	Platform SDK February 2003). This version of the PSDK is available on the 
	Microsoft web site at
	<a href="http://www.microsoft.com/msdownload/platformsdk/sdkupdate/psdk-full.htm">
	http://www.microsoft.com/msdownload/platformsdk/sdkupdate/psdk-full.htm</a>. 
	It can be ordered online at
	<a href="http://www.qmedia.ca/launch/psdk.htm">
	http://www.qmedia.ca/launch/psdk.htm</a>, and it's also available to 
	Microsoft MSDN subscribers on the Subscribers Downloads web site.<li>Microsoft Visual C++ 6.0 
	with Service Pack 5 or 6 (both the service packs are available online on the 
	Microsoft web site).</ul>
<p>If your system satisfies these requirements, follow these steps:</p>
<ol>
  <li>From the Windows NT Start menu, select the folder <em>Programs</em> and
    then <i>Development Kits</i>, then <em>Windows NT4 DDK.</em> From here select the voice 
	<em>Checked Build
    Environment</em> if you want to build a debug version, or <em>Free Build
    Environment</em> if you want to build a release version.
  <li>A command prompt will be opened. Move to the directory PacketNTx inside the
    WinPcap source folder and type the command<br><br><i>CompileDriver<br></i>
	<br>This script will generate the driver (npf.sys). The binary will be put in 
	one of these folders<ul>
	<li><i>Free Build Environment: </i>winpcap\PacketNTx\driver\bin\NT4\i386\free</li>
	<li><i>Checked Build Environment: </i>winpcap\PacketNTx\driver\bin\NT4\i386\checked</li>
	</ul>
</ol>
<p><b>Warning</b>: sometimes, during the compilation of the driver, a lot of
'last line incomplete' errors are generated. Ignore these errors and let the
compilation process continue, they are due to bugs in some DDK versions.</p>
<h3>Compiling the driver on Windows 2000/XP/2003/Vista (32bit and 
64bit AMD64)</h3>
<p>Software requirements:</p>
<ul>
	<li>Microsoft Driver Developer Kit (DDK) for Windows Windows
    XP or Windows Server 2003. As of WinPcap 4.0, the preferred DDK 
	environment is &quot;DDK for Windows Server 2003SP1&quot;, also known as DDK 
	3790.1830.</li>
</ul>
<p>NOTE: it is possible to use older DDKs for Windows 2000, but you will need to 
manually modify the compilation scripts in order to disable PREfast (PREfast is 
a static code analysis tool shipped with recent versions of the DDK).</p>
<p>If your system satisfies these requirements, follow these steps:</p>
<ol>
  <li>From the Windows Start menu, select the folder <em>Programs</em> and
    then <i>Development Kits</i>, then <em>Windows XXX DDK</em>, where <em>XXX</em> is
    the target system, then <em>Build Environments</em>.<ul>
	<li>32bit driver: Choose <em>Windows 2000</em> and then <em>Windows 2000 Free Build 
	Environment</em>if you want to build a release version or <em>Windows 2000 
	Checked Build Environment </em>if you want to build a debug version . </li>
	<li>64bit AMD64 driver: Choose <em>Windows Server 2003</em> and then <em>Windows 
	Server 2003 Free&nbsp; x64 Build Environment </em>if you want to build a release version or
	<em>Windows Server 2003 
	Checked x64 Build Environment </em>if you want to build a debug version . </li>
	</ul>
	<li>A command prompt will be opened. Move to the directory PacketNTx inside the
    WinPcap source folder and type the command<br><br><i>CompileDriver<br></i>
	<br>This script will generate the driver (npf.sys). The binary will be put in 
	one of these folders<ul>
		<li><i>32bit driver (both Free and Checked Build): </i>winpcap\PacketNTx\driver\bin\2k\i386</li>
		<li><i>64bit AMD64 driver (both Free and Checked Build): </i>winpcap\PacketNTx\driver\bin\xp\amd64</li>
	</ul>
  </ol>
<h3>Compiling the driver on Windows 9x</h3>
<p><font color="#FF0000">NOTE: this Windows platform is no longer supported by 
WinPcap. However, the sources for these operating systems are still available in 
the sources package.</font></p>
<p>To compile the driver for Windows 9x you will need:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Driver Developer Kit (DDK) for Windows 95/98/ME
  <li>A recent version of the Microsoft Platform Software Development Kit (SDK) 
	that is compatible with Visual Studio 6 (the latest compatible one is 
	Platform SDK February 2003). This version of the PSDK is available on the 
	Microsoft web site at
	<a href="http://www.microsoft.com/msdownload/platformsdk/sdkupdate/psdk-full.htm">
	http://www.microsoft.com/msdownload/platformsdk/sdkupdate/psdk-full.htm</a>. 
	It can be ordered online at
	<a href="http://www.qmedia.ca/launch/psdk.htm">
	http://www.qmedia.ca/launch/psdk.htm</a>, and it's also available to 
	Microsoft MSDN subscribers on the Subscribers Downloads web site.<li>Microsoft Visual C++ 6.0 
	with Service Pack 5 or 6 (both the service packs are available online on the 
	Microsoft web site).</ul>
<p>The steps to follow are:</p>
<ol>
  <li>Open a DOS shell
  <li>Go to the VisualC++ BIN directory (for example C:\DEVSTUDIO\VC\BIN) and
    execute the command<br>
    <br>
    <em>Vcvars32<br>
    </em>
  <li>Go to the SDK directory (for example C:\MSSDK) and execute the command<br>
    <br>
    <em>Setenv sdk_path</em><br>
    <br>
    where <em>sdk_path</em> is the directory of SDK (for example Setenv C:\MSSDK)
  <li>Go to the DDK directory (for example C:\DDK) and execute the command<br>
    <br>
    <em>Ddkenv 32 net<br>
    </em>
  <li>Move to the directory whit the driver's source code and type the command<br>
    <br>
    <em>nmake rtl<br>
    <br>
    </em>to obtain a release version, or<br>
    <br>
    <em>nmake<br>
    <br>
    </em>to obtain a debug version.<br>The release version of <i>packet.vxd</i> will be placed in the 
	<em>retail</em>
    directory, the debug version in the <em>debug</em> directory.</li>
</ol>
<p><strong>Warning</strong>: On some systems the NMAKE utility is not able to
launch ADRC2VXD, this means that the driver binary is generated correctly, but
without the copyright information. We don't know the cause of this problem.</p>
<h2>Compiling packet.dll</h2>
<p>The source tree for this DLL is located in PacketNTx\dll\.</p>
<p><font color="#FF0000">NOTE: the 9x family of Windows operating systems is no longer supported 
by WinPcap. However, the sources for these operating systems are still available 
in the sources package.</font></p>
<p>Software requirements:</p>
<ul>
	<li>A recent version of the Microsoft Platform Software Development Kit 
	(SDK) that is compatible with Visual Studio 6 (the latest compatible one is

	It can be ordered online at <a href="http://www.qmedia.ca/launch/psdk.htm">
	http://www.qmedia.ca/launch/psdk.htm</a>, and it's also available to 
	Microsoft MSDN subscribers on the Subscribers Downloads web site.<br><b>Note</b>: if you use Microsoft Visual Studio .NET the platform SDK is 
	<b>not</b> 
	needed to compile packet.dll.<li>Microsoft Visual C++ 6.0 with Service Pack 
	5 or 6 (both the service packs are available online on the Microsoft web 
	site).<li>If you want to build WinPcap with the support for the CACE 
	Technologies AirPcap wireless capture library, you will need to download the 
	AirPcap developer's pack from
	<a href="http://www.cacetech.com/products/airpcap.htm">
	http://www.cacetech.com/products/airpcap.htm</a>. The AirPcap developer's 
	pack needs to be unzipped in a folder in the same folder where the WinPcap 
	sources have been unzipped.</ul>
<p>To compile the PACKET.DLL, load the project contained in the directory PacketNTx\dll\project
in the Visual C++ IDE. There are several project 
configurations:</p>
<ul>
  <li><i>PacketNT - Win32</i> <i>Release</i>: standard release configuration</li>
  <li><i>PacketNT - Win32 Debug</i>: standard debug configuration</li>
  <li><i>PacketNT - Win32</i> <i>Release No AirPcap</i>: standard release configuration, 
	without AirPcap support</li>
  <li><i>PacketNT - Win32 Debug No AirPcap</i>: standard debug configuration, 
	without AirPcap support</li>
  <li><i>PacketNT - Win32 NT4 Release</i>: release configuration able to run on 
  NT4 does not include Wan and IP helper API support.</li>
	<li><i>PacketNT - Win32 NT4 Debug</i>: debug configuration able to run on NT4 
  does not include Wan and IP helper API support.</li>
  <li><i>PacketNT - Win32 Release Vista</i>: release configuration able to run on 
  Vista. It 
  does not include Wan support (with the NetMon API).</li>
	<li><i>PacketNT - Win32 Debug Vista</i>: debug configuration able to run on 
	Vista. It 
  does not include Wan support (with the NetMon API).</li>
	<li><i>WanPacket - Win32 Release</i>: release version of the WanPacket 
  library, used to interface with NetMon API for Wan capture</li>
	<li><i>WanPacket - Win32 Debug</i>: debug version of the WanPacket library, 
  used to interface with NetMon API for Wan capture</li>
</ul>
<p>Choose the desired configuration and build the project to obtain the binary 
files.</p>
<h2>Compiling wpcap.dll</h2>
<p>wpcap.dll can be compiled on any Win32 platform and the generated dll is system independent.</p>
<p>System Requirements:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Microsoft Visual C++ 6.0 with Service Pack 5 or 6 (both the service packs 
	are available online on the Microsoft web site).</li>
	<li>A recent version of the Microsoft Platform Software Development Kit 
	(SDK) that is compatible with Visual Studio 6 (the latest compatible one is 
	Platform SDK February 2003). This version of the PSDK is available on the 
	Microsoft web site at
	<a href="http://www.microsoft.com/msdownload/platformsdk/sdkupdate/psdk-full.htm">
	http://www.microsoft.com/msdownload/platformsdk/sdkupdate/psdk-full.htm</a>. 
	It can be ordered online at
	<a href="http://www.qmedia.ca/launch/psdk.htm">
	http://www.qmedia.ca/launch/psdk.htm</a>, and it's also available to 
	Microsoft MSDN subscribers on the Subscribers Downloads web site.<br>
	<b>Note</b>: if you use Microsoft Visual Studio .Net the platform SDK is <b>not</b> 
	needed to compile wpcap.dll.</li>
	<li>Project files are in the <i>directory winpcap\wpcap\prj</i> of the WinPcap source 
code distribution. Load wpcap.dsw from the Visual C++ IDE and build the program.</li>
	<li>If you want to build WinPcap with the support for the CACE Technologies 
	AirPcap wireless capture library, you will need to download the AirPcap 
	developer's pack from <a href="http://www.cacetech.com/products/airpcap.htm">
	http://www.cacetech.com/products/airpcap.htm</a>. The AirPcap developer's 
	pack needs to be unzipped in the same folder where the WinPcap sources have been unzipped.<br>
	<br>
	There are eight build project configurations:<b><br><br>No support for Remore Capture, 
	support for AirPcap, no support for DAG</b></li>
	<li><i>Wpcap debug</i>: output folder winpcap\wpcap\prj\Debug </li>
	<li><i>Wpcap release</i>: output folder winpcap\wpcap\prj\Release<b><br>
	<br>
	Support for Remore Capture, no support for AirPcap, no support for 
	DAG</b></li>
	<li><i>Wpcap debug REMOTE NO AIRPCAP</i>: output folder winpcap\wpcap\prj\Debug_REMOTE_NO_AIRPCAP</li>
	<li><i>Wpcap release REMOTE NO AIRPCAP</i>: output folder winpcap\wpcap\prj\Release_REMOTE_NO_AIRPCAP<p>
	<b>Support for Remore Capture, support for AirPcap, no support for DAG</b></li>
	<li><i>Wpcap debug REMOTE</i>: output folder winpcap\wpcap\prj\Debug_REMOTE</li>
	<li><i>Wpcap release REMOTE</i>: output folder winpcap\wpcap\prj\Release_REMOTE<br><b><br>
	Support for Remore Capture, support for AirPcap, support for DAG</b></li>
	<li><i>Wpcap debug REMOTE DAG</i>: output folder winpcap\wpcap\prj\Debug_REMOTE_DAG</li>
	<li><i>Wpcap release REMOTE DAG</i>: output folder winpcap\wpcap\prj\Release_REMOTE_DAG</li>
</ul>
<p><i>Note</i>: wpcap.dll contains the source code of libpcap from
<a href="http://www.tcpdump.org">www.tcpdump.org</a>, with some modifications 
for remote capture. You will be able to include and build a different libpcap 
version simply copying it in the directory <i>winpcap\wpcap\prj</i> of the 
WinPcap source code distribution, but you must use the &quot;Debug&quot; or &quot;Release&quot; 
build configurations.<br>
